## Project Overview üéâ
This is my approach to create a twitch chat bot that is capable to performing more difficult actions than commercially used bots. Project is maintained with a bit of humour, as it is supposed to work on my friends' stream. Right now the bot is reading the chat, responding to specific !commands (ex. !iq), is using database if needed. Project is still in development.

## Installation üíæ

Clone the repository. In Your virtual environment type "pip install PySide2" "pip install peewee" "pip install urlfetch". While in the virtual env go to repo directory and start "main.py", on the first run you need to fill the settings tab using proper data (OAuth token, account name for bot, channel to join). After saving and starting the bot should connect to the provided channel.


## Live üìç
Project is still in development, so I didnt prepared Live version to download and use. But soon I will host my bot so it will be permanently online on this [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/leon_official) so You can check it's amazing features by Yourself.
